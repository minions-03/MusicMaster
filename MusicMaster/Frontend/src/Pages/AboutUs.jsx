              MusicMaster began with a vision to make quality instruments 
              accessible to musicians of every level. What started as a small 
              collection for local artists has grown into a trusted online 
              platform serving musicians worldwide.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              We carefully select every guitar, piano, drum, and violin to 
              ensure top-notch quality, durability, and sound. Whether you’re 
              a beginner taking your first step into music or a professional 
              artist, our mission is to help you create melodies that inspire.
